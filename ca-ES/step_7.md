## Challenge: Compose a new tune

Now take what you've learnt and compose your own tune. It could be a doorbell chime, mobile ringtone or notification.

Use `play`, `sleep` and `times` to create your own more interesting tune.

Remember, higher numbers play higher notes and numbers 21 to 108 correspond to the notes on the piano.

You can also record your tune as a '.wav' file.
