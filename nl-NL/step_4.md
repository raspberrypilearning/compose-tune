## Repeat the chime

Doorbells often repeat the chime.

+ Let's put the doorbell chime into a loop:

    Sonic Pi will helpfully indent the doorbell chime code inside the `times` loop.

+ Listen to the chime. Is it what you expected?
    
    You'll need to add a `sleep` line at the end so that there's a pause before repeating:

+ Listen to the chime again and it should sound better.
