* Playing musical notes using midi numbers
* Repetition

This project covers elements from the following strands of the [Raspberry Pi Digital Making Curriculum](http://rpf.io/curriculum):

* [使用基本的編程結構來創造簡單的程序。](https://www.raspberrypi.org/curriculum/programming/creator)

## 挑戰

* "Improve the chime" - try using different notes and timings to improve the doorbell chime.
* "Repeat 4 times" - make the doorbell chime repeat 4 times to be really annoying!
* "Compose a new tune" - use the skills learned to program a new tune such as a mobile phone ringtone.

## 常見問題

* The numbers used are midi numbers, numbers 21 to 108 correspond to the notes on the piano.
* On the Raspberry Pi you can use `aplay` from the command line to play `.wav` files.
